About the Application and Content Source

Free TV is a free IPTV streaming application. All TV channels and stream URLs available in the Application are sourced from publicly available, open-source repositories, primarily the IPTV-org open-source playlist hosted on GitHub.

The Company does not host, own, store, control, or retransmit any television channels or media content. The Application only indexes and plays stream URLs that are already publicly accessible on the internet.

All streams are delivered directly from their respective third-party hosts. If a stream becomes unavailable, stops working, or is removed by its host, this is outside the control of the Company.

If any channel owner, copyright holder, or authority raises a concern regarding content availability, the Company is willing to remove the relevant stream from the Application.

Legal and Copyright Disclaimer

Free TV does not claim ownership of any media content displayed in the Application. All trademarks, logos, channel names, and media belong to their respective owners.

The Company does not guarantee the legality, quality, accuracy, or availability of any stream. Responsibility for stream legality lies with the original stream providers and hosting entities.

If you believe that any content available through the Application infringes copyright or applicable laws, you may contact the Company, and appropriate action will be taken.

Collecting and Using Your Data

Personal Data

The Company does not collect personally identifiable information such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, precise location data, or payment information.

Location Information (Country Only)

The Application may determine the User’s country based on the User’s IP address using publicly available third-party APIs. This information is used solely to personalize the content experience, such as showing relevant country-specific TV channels.

The country information is not stored, not linked to any user account, and not used for tracking, profiling, or identification purposes.

Usage Data

Usage Data may be collected automatically when using the Service. This may include information such as device type, operating system version, basic app usage events, and diagnostic data such as crash reports.

This data is primarily collected by third-party services used in the Application and is used to improve app performance and stability.

Advertising

Free TV displays advertisements using Google AdMob.

Google AdMob may collect information such as device identifiers, IP address, and usage data to provide and measure advertisements. The Company does not control how Google collects or processes this data.

Advertising-related data is handled in accordance with Google’s Privacy Policy. Users are encouraged to review Google’s privacy practices for more information.

Internet Access and Streaming Permissions

The Application requires internet access to load IPTV playlists, stream publicly available television channels, and display advertisements.

Some streams use HTTP (cleartext) URLs. To support these publicly available streams, the Application allows cleartext traffic only for specific, known streaming domains.

This configuration is limited strictly to streaming functionality and is not used for collecting or transmitting personal user data.

Third-Party Services

The Application relies on third-party services such as advertising providers and third-party IPTV stream hosts.

The Company is not responsible for the content, availability, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party services or websites accessed through the Application.

Children’s Privacy

The Service is not directed to children under the age of 13. The Company does not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 years of age. If such data is discovered, it will be removed promptly.

Data Retention

The Company does not store personal user data on its own servers.

Any data collected by third-party services is retained according to their respective privacy policies.

Security

The security of user data is important to the Company. Reasonable measures are taken to protect the Application and its users. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure, and absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

The Company may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the "Last updated" date will be revised accordingly.

Continued use of the Application after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
